# Week 1: Introduction to Simulation

In robotics, simulation is an indispensable tool. It allows us to design, test, and iterate on our robot's hardware and software in a virtual environment before deploying it in the real world. This saves time, money, and reduces the risk of damaging expensive hardware.

## Why Simulate?

- **Safety:** Test dangerous scenarios without risk to humans or hardware.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Avoid costly repairs and replacements of physical robots.
- **Speed:** Run tests faster than real-time.
- **Parallelization:** Run multiple tests simultaneously.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure consistent test conditions.

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical object. In our case, it's a virtual model of our robot and its environment. A good digital twin not only looks like the real thing but also behaves like it, accurately simulating physics, sensors, and actuators.

## Simulation Tools

In this chapter, we will focus on two popular simulation tools:

- **Gazebo:** A powerful and widely used robotics simulator that is tightly integrated with ROS.
- **Unity:** A popular game engine that is increasingly being used for high-fidelity robotics simulation, especially for training AI models with photorealistic rendering.
